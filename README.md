## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

No frameworks, no build tools — just vanilla JS.

## 💡 Why this exists

To sharpen fundamentals, test silly ideas, and build a habit of shipping in public. If it helps you too, feel free to fork, clone, or suggest something!
